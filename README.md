# Statistical Math Web Application

### This app is designed to help users learn statistical math in a fun and safe environment. Users can earn points by making correct guesses, with the points varying depending on whether they choose to receive step-by-step guidance for each task. 

## How to use

### On the left side, you can choose the type of calculation you want to perform. The app then displays a page for that specific statistical equation, with a brief description, a set of numbers, and a field where you can submit your answer. If you answer correctly, you earn 1 point. If you get it wrong, you can keep trying until you get it right or move on to another task. You also get a step-by-step guide for each calculation. Points are saved during your session but will reset when the app is closed.
